# The Legend Of Darkmoor
Java remake of the classic RPG Eye Of The Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon for Android, iOS and PC platforms

The project is based on libGDX (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) and it's currently under development. 
It consists mainly of an engine to generate dungeon crawlers in the style of the classic E.O.B. The engine resource system is compatible with 
Dungeon Eye (http://www.dungeoneye.net/). This previous remake offers even an editor for resources and levels, which can be used to generate multi platform games with the darkmoor engine.

The current stage of implementation of the game covers:
* Loading a predefined saved game. That's for now the only way to enter the game, no new adventure party can be created
* setting some options, music, hit points as bar/numbers, etc..
* moving into the dungeon freely, forest, temple level 1,2 and dungeons. Enjoy while there are no enemies around! (hurry, arriving any moment now)
* swinging weapons...but in the air

more features coming up soon. contributors are welcome.
